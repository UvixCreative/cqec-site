## Participate at your leisure
Your participation is welcomed but should never be forced.

## Ask questions
Space is provided to ask questions. Please be considerate and thoughtful when doing so.


## Speak your truth using “I” statements
Speak for yourself, not for others.


## Right to pass
If a question is asked, you have the right to not answer.


## Exercise empathy, generosity, grace, and humility
Let's aim to make it easy for everyone to feel comfortable sharing.


## Be open to different people, viewpoints, and experiences
Embrace diversity and find value in differing perspectives.


## Remember your power and privilege
Bring awareness to how your position may impact the conversation.


## Explore your discomfort
Lean into challenging topics and conversations to help us grow together.


## Call people in, not out
Engage in conversation with an invitation, not a demand.


## Stories stay, lessons leave
Keep what’s shared in this space in mind as lessons to carry forward, without judgment.


## Take space, make space
Ensure everyone has an opportunity to share and contribute.
