We're happy to announce **Chattanooga Queer Empowerment Collective's** new website!

The goal of the site is to provide an place for people to find us and learn about who we are. The [homepage](/) also hosts an "important links" section for quick access to up-to-date resources or surveys.

We also have a [Calendar](/calendar) to make it easy to keep up with events, as well as a [Blog](/blog) where we will announce details of new events and request volunteers[^1].

With this change, we're hoping to make it easier for people to find and keep up with our news and events outside of traditional social media.
